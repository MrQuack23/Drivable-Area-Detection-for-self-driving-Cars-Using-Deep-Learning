### Abstract
This review explores the application of deep learning techniques for drivable area detection in autonomous vehicles, focusing on semantic segmentation models. The BDD100K dataset serves as a benchmark for evaluating prominent models, including UNet and DeepLabV3+. The analysis highlights the superior performance of DeepLabV3+, with a Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU) of 0.82, establishing it as a reference model for further exploration. The review also examines optimization techniques such as 8-bit quantization, magnitude-based pruning, and class-based thresholding (CBT) early exiting. Magnitude-based pruning demonstrated a substantial model size reduction of 66.53% while maintaining the same performance with a Mean IoU of 0.81, but attempts to implement CBT early exiting were hindered by resource limitations. These insights underscore the potential of optimized deep learning models in real-time drivable area detection, contributing to the advancement of autonomous driving systems.
